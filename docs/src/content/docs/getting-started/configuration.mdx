description: How to connect bitbucket-go-mcp to your MCP client.

Once downloaded, you need to register the binary with an MCP-compliant application like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Zed.

## Client Registration

Modify your client's MCP configuration settings to point local invocations to the absolute path of the executable.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitbucket": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/bitbucket-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication Environments

The server provides two ways to authenticate:

### 1. App Passwords (Headless)
Define `BITBUCKET_USERNAME` and `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD` in the `env` block as presented above. This works best for CI/CD environments or stable headless integrations.

### 2. Interactive OAuth 2.0 (Desktop)
If you omit the credentials, `bitbucket-go-mcp` will dynamically spawn a localized HTTP server and open an interactive authorization window via `https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize` automatically. It will trap the callback to validate connection state. 

If running an OAuth flow, ensure you configure `BITBUCKET_CLIENT_ID` and `BITBUCKET_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `env` if using a custom OAuth registration.
